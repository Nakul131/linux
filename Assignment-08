1.  What is a user-defined function in shell scripting? Explain with an example.
Ans:
A user-defined function is a block of resuable code created by the user to perform a specific task. It also avoids repetition and makes scripts modular.
Ex: #!/bin/bash
greet() {
	echo “Hello,  $1!”
}
greet  “Nakul”

Output:
Hello,  Nakul!




2. Write a bash script with a function that multiply two integer numbers.
Ans :
#!/bin/bash
multiply() {
	result=$(( $1 * $2 ))
	echo “product: $result”
}
echo  “enter first number:”
read a
 echo  “enter second number:”
read b
multiply $a $b

Output: Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 4
Product: 20

3. Explain how arrays (1D, 2D, and 3D) are declared in bash scripting.
Ans:
	1D Array:
arr=(10 20 30 40)
echo ${arr[2]}
Output: 30
	2D Array:
arr2D=(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
rows=3; cols=3
index=$(( (2-1)*cols + (3-1) ))
echo ${arr2D[$index]}   
Output: 6
	3D Array:
      		 declare -A arr3D
    		 arr3D["0,0,1"]=20
       		 echo ${arr3D["0,0,1"]}  
 	Output: 20

4. Write a shell script to display elements of an array.
Ans:
#!/bin/bash
arr=(apple banana mango orange)
echo "Array elements:"
for item in "${arr[@]}"
do
  echo "$item"
done

Output: 
Array elements:
apple
banana
mango
orange



5. What is the purpose of cron in Linux?
Ans:
Cron is a time-based job schedular used to automatically execute commands or scripts at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
Ex: daily backups, log cleanup

6. Write a cron job to run a backup script every day at midnight.
Ans:
Open the cron table using:
crontab -e
Add this line:
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Rubs backup.sh every day at 00:00 midnight.

      
7. How do you schedule a one-time job using at command?
Ans:
The at command schedules a single job for  a specific time.
Ex:
at 10:30 PM
at> /home/user/backup.sh
at> <Ctrl+D>
This runs backup.sh once at 10:30 PM.
       



8. Write a script to display disk usage using df and du.
Ans:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Disk space usage:"
df -h
echo "Directory usage details:"
du -sh *

Output:
Disk space usage:
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   20G   30G  40% /
Directory usage details:
1.2G  Documents
800M  Downloads


9. How can you log the output of a script using the tee command?
Ans:
Use the tee command to display and save output at the same time.
Ex:
#!/bin/bash
echo "System update log:" | tee update_log.txt
sudo apt update | tee -a update_log.txt
Output appears on screen and gets saved in update_log.txt.

    
10. Explain with an example how shell scripting can automate system administration tasks.
Ans:
Shell scripts can automate tasks like backups, system updates, and log cleaning.
Ex:  Automatic Backup Script
#!/bin/bash
backup_file="/backup/home_$(date +%F).tar.gz"
tar -czf $backup_file /home/user
echo "Backup completed on $(date)" >> /var/log/backup.log
Schedule it using cron:
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Automatically creates daily backups at midnight.
