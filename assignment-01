1.	What is Linux Operating System (OS)? List three pros and cons of it.

Ans :- It is a free and open source operating system based on the linux
And it can share charcterstices with the original unix  system

Pros:-
•	Source code is openly available
•	It is permission based system,less vulnerable to viruses
•	Change almost everthing about how the system looks

Cons:-
•	Commercial applications are not officially available,available  in unofficaially only.
•	Not a beginner friendly,it is difficult to understand
•	Without proper drivers ,device may not be work.


2.	 Differentiate between Linux, Mac, Android, and Windows OS with at least six unique features.

Ans:- 	 Linux :-
•	It can be modify and distrubt the source code is freely available.
•	Can use alternative like virtual machine
•	It is good for servers,coding etc…
•	It have a commercial software limatations like MS office,AutoCAD,etc……
•	Servers and embedded devices it is the best choice
•	Not good for gamers,designers,etc….


Mac:-
•	It cannot be modified and distrubt the source code because it is controlled by apple and Microsoft
•	Built on a UNIX kernel
•	Strict app store policies
•	Stable and developer friendly
•	Exlusive hardware runs only in apple devices like MacBook,etc…
•	It is developer toolbox ,powerfull but it requires skill

Android :-
•	It is also closed -source code developed by google hence it cannot be modified and distrubt
•	It is particularly designed for smartphones,tablets from various manufactures because hardware support
•	It is designed for user-friendly mobile experience
•	It designed for touchskreens,simple graphical interface,etc…
•	It allow access vast libirary of applications from google play store
•	World most usable mobile OS


Windows :-
•	It is also closed-source code developed by Microsoft hence it cannot be modified and distrubt
•	Supporting a vide range of devices
•	Particularly designed for personal computers,laptops,etc…
•	Strict control on system behavior and appearance
•	It made for user-friendly with little technical knowlodge
•	Used in everyhwhere,particularly in offices and gaming


3.	Why is Linux preferred for Mainframe Servers for legacy application? Give three out-of-the-box technical reasons. 

Ans:- because
•	It has a high stability and reliability ,its robust security architecture that can handle complex permission structures that essential for legacy software
•	Its flexibility and customizability, ability to run on wide range of hardware,including older systems that also provide compatibility and functionality for older software
•	Enchanced security and access control,it have multiple granular uer permission and multiple authentication methods and it prevents the unautharized changes or breaches


4.	Explain the structure of the Linux File System with proper diagram. Note: you can use the tree command to find it out.

Ans:- Daigram reprensentation of file system tree
    /
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
•	Directories in linux

	/ - starting point of the file system 
	/root – the home directory for the root user
	/tmp – temporary files created by users and applications
	/lib – stores essential shared libraries required by programs
	/opt – third party software packages
	/run – stores volatile runtime data
	/srv – holds data for services provided by the system
	/dev – shows device flows
	/var- variable data



5.	If Linux OS is open-source, how do companies like Red Hat still making money from it? Do a market study and answer properly.
Ans : -     companies making money by selling services,not by the software itself and also give with safe and tested version of linux 
               companies they want a secure,reliable,and supported linux
              Red hat earns money by subscriptions,training ,consulting,cloud         partnership 
             Demand raising on hybrid IT,DevOps and secure system 
            market is growing is fast estimately $100 billion by 2032


6.	Write the command to display today’s date and time (i.e., current System time). 
Ans:- date,time/T
7.	Which command is used to check how long the system has been running? 

Ans:- uptime

8.	What is the difference between shutdown -h now and halt? 

Ans:-   shutdown -h now  -- attempts to power off the machine after
Halt – typically stops the CPU and leaves the system on


9.	Compare init 0 and shutdown -h. Which is safer? Why? 

Ans:-  shutdown -h safer than the init 0 because -h perform a more complete shutdown process by terminating all running process it execute in more gracefully and prepare the system for safe power off
Init 0 not safe because it performs lower level operations and leads to data inconsistencies or corruption

10. A system administrator accidentally powers off a Server machine without shutting it down properly. What problems can occur to the said Server? 

Ans:-   file system corruption like data in RAM may not be written to disk 
 unsaved  and in progress database transactions may be wased out
they may be critical to restart correctly after reboot
sudden power off cause stress to hard disk
without proper shutdown lead to crashed files,lost data,etc……….
