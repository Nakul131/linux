1.What is a bash shell script? Give one example.
ANS:
A bash shell script is a plain text file containing a sequence of commands (and control logic) that the bash shell (or compatible shell) can interpret and execute, as if you typed those commands interactively. DataCamp+2GeeksforGeeks+2
In other words, it is a way to automate a sequence of shell commands, with logic (conditionals, loops, variables, functions) to make scripts more powerful.
Eg:
#!/bin/bash
# This script prints a greeting
echo "Welcome to my script!"
2. Write a simple shell script to print “Hello World”.
ANS:
echo "Hello World"
3. What do shell script comments (#) serve as?
ANS:

You can add notes or explanations to a script by leaving comments (lines that begin with #). They are only for you (or anybody else reading your script later), and the shell ignores them when the script is running. They could be used for:

Describe the function of a code block.

Mark reminders or "TODOs."

Temporarily disable a command.
4. How do you declare variables in, float, double, string, Boolean and char in shell script?
ANS:
In bash, all variables are treated as strings by default.
There is no specific data type (like int or float), but you can use them accordingly.

Example:

#!/bin/bash
int_var=10          # Integer
float_var=10.5      # Float (string form)
double_var=20.55    # Double (string form)
string_var="Hello"  # String
bool_var=true       # Boolean
char_var='A'        # Character

echo $int_var $float_var $string_var $bool_var $char_var
5.write a shell script to display the current date and time of the system?
ANS:
echo “ current date and time:$(date)”

6. Explain the difference between a constant and a variable in a bash script?
ANS:
Feature variable constant definition value can change during exhibition. Value remains fixed throughout execution.
Eg:
Name= “Nakul”
Readonly pi=3.14
echo “Name:$name,pi=$pi”
7. Write a shell script to read two integer numbers from the user and compute the sum?
ANS:
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter first number: " num1
read -p "Enter second number: " num2
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Sum: $sum"

8. What is the use of source command in shell scripting?

The source command (or .) is used to execute a script in the current shell rather than starting a new one.
It’s useful when you want to apply changes to environment variables or functions in the current shell session.
Eg:
source myscript.sh
or
. myscript.sh

 9. How can you debug a shell script? Give two methods.
ANS:
Method 1: Run the script with the -x option
bash -x script.sh
This shows each command before it executes.
Method 2: Add set -x and set +x inside the script
#!/bin/bash
set -x  # Start debugging
echo "Debugging this line"
set +x  # Stop debugging

10. Write a bash script to create and delete a file.
ANS:
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter file name: " filename

# Create a file
touch $filename
echo "File '$filename' created successfully."

# Delete the file
rm $filename
echo "File '$filename' deleted successfully."
