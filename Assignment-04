1.	Extract usernames from /etc/passwd using grep and tee?
To get the usernames (usernames refer to the first column in /etc/passwd which is separated by : ) use:
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | tee usernames.txt
•	cut -d: -f1: Extracts the first field (username).
•	tee usernames.txt: Writes the output to usernames.txt and displays it on screen.
2. Binary not found in $PATH — use which, find, locate?
•	which : Checks if binary is in $PATH.
•	find / -type f -name 2>/dev/null: Searches entire system for the binary.
•	locate : Uses a prebuilt index to find the file quickly.
To fix the issue:
•	If the binary is found, just add its directory to the $PATH:export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binary 
3. Find .log files modified in last 24 hours and save to file?
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -1 > log_report.txt
•	-mtime -1: Modified in last 24 hours.
•	Redirects output to log_report.txt.
4. Difference: shutdown -r now vs reboot?
CommandDescriptionshutdown -r nowShuts down and restarts the system immediately with proper notifications to logged-in users.rebootImmediately restarts the system, similar to shutdown -r, but might skip some user notifications depending system configuration.
5. Debug a script using tee for stdout and stderr?
./yourscript.sh > >(tee output.log) 2> >(tee error.log &2)
•	Stdout is written to output.log while stderr is written to error.log. 
•	Both streams are also printed on the display. 
6. Three real-world applications of Linux in industries?
Web Servers: Apache, Nginx on Linux are hosting most of the world’s websites. 
•	Embedded Systems: Linux is used in IoT devices, smart TVs, and routers (e.g., OpenWrt). 
•	Cloud Computing: Linux is the backbone of cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. 
7. Differences: Application, System, and Utility Software in Linux?
Software Type	Description	Example (Linux)
System Software	Manages hardware & core OS functionality	Linux Kernel, GRUB
Utility Software	Performs system maintenance tasks	fsck, top, du
Application Software	User-centric programs for specific tasks	Firefox, LibreOffice
8. What’s the difference between open-source and proprietary operating systems? (CO2)
Open-source	Proprietary
Free to use and modify	Usually paid and closed-source
Community-supported	Supported by vendors (like Microsoft)
Examples: Linux, FreeBSD	Examples: Windows, macOS
With open-source, you get more freedom. With proprietary, you get official support but less control.

9. How do I check the system’s kernel version? (CO3)
Simple:
uname -r
This shows something like: 6.5.0-25-generic — that’s your Linux kernel version

10. What’s the difference between head and tail? (CO1)
•	head: Shows the first lines of a file.
•	head -n 5 filename.txt
•	tail: Shows the last lines of a file.
•	tail -n 5 filename.txt
These are useful when you're checking logs or previewing a file.
